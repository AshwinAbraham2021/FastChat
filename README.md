CS 251 (Software Systems Lab) Course Project by
- Ananth Krishna Kidambi
- Ashwin Abraham

This project aims to build a network of clients interacting with each other with the help of some servers acting as mediators. This is much like how WhatsApp operates. The main focus is to
- Obtain high throughput with limited resources dedicated to the servers
- At the same time ensuring low latency of individual message deliveries and E2E encryption between clients
